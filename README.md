# Flutter App - A Practical Demonstration of Software Best Practices

This repository contains a Flutter application developed as a demonstration of my skills and expertise in creating efficient and user-friendly software. The app incorporates design patterns to enhance performance and applies the SOLID principles for maintainability and scalability. Throughout the development process, I used DevTools to analyze and optimize the app's performance. Additionally, the project follows Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture principles and employs Test-Driven Development (TDD) for critical components such as the repository and remote data source.

## Project Overview

This project is designed as a portfolio piece to showcase my:

- Expertise in applying design patterns to improve software performance.
- Use of SOLID principles for scalable and maintainable code.
- Ability to analyze and optimize performance using DevTools.
- Backend development skills with Supabase, emphasizing normalized database design.
- Application of Clean Architecture principles for code structure.
- Implementation of Test-Driven Development (TDD) for robust functionality.
- Integration of push notifications and deep linking for enhanced user engagement.
- Featuring a user-friendly, responsive design enhanced with smooth and engaging animations to provide an exceptional user experience.


Although the app is not fully complete, it is a practice project intended to demonstrate my capabilities and approach to development.
